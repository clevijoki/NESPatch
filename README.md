# NESPatch

A patch for the Hoxton Owl pedal that makes your guitar sound like an NES. This does no pitch or frequency detection, it shapes the existing waves, so all guitar harmonics remain present.

## Knobs

1. Blend between a square shape and triangle shape.
1. Shape the triangle between a triangle and saw shape.
1. Add a synthetic "attack" which is just a short burst of noise to emulate now a NES might simulate a guitar attack.
1. Adjust compression

# Installing

Currently the only way to install it is via flashing the pedal with OwlWare.bin
